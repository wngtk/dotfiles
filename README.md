My personal configuration files. They are designed for a VSCode + NEOVIM stack. You can "install" (by symlinking) the configs using

```sh
./install
```

### VSCode + NVIM
- Will allow linux shell commands with `!` only when remote host is linux/WSL.
- [Install VSCodeVim extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim)
- Update global [settings.json](./vscode/settings.json)
